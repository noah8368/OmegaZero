### Project Summary

OmegaZero is a chess engine built from scratch which allows a user to play 
against an AI. The name "OmegaZero" is an homage to [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero), a program
developed by [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) that was used to create one of the world's
best Chess engines. The [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) was referenced heavily during
development. Credit goes to [Bradon Hsu](https://github.com/2brandonh) for designing the
logo for this project.

### Status: Abandoned Branch

A neural network was trained to evaluate board states in this branch. However,
this approach was not very successful, and added many project dependencies that
muddied the project organization. As such, this branch has been abandoned, and
will be preserved for historical purposes.

### Usage

#### Prerequisites

The included `Makefile` is designed to run on GNU/Linux machines. The [Boost library](https://www.boost.org/)
is a requirement, and should be installed locally before compilation.
On Ubuntu systems, users may use the `apt-get` package manager to
install Boost like so:
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
You'll also need to install the [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) module if you wish to train
the evaluation network. This can be done using `pip`:
```
pip3 install chess
```

#### Building the Engine

To build the software, simply type `make` in the root directory of the project.
This will take several minutes as the `magics.cc` file takes quite
a while to build. To completely clean a build, `make purge` will remove the
entire build directory. To remove all object files except for the one generated
by `magics.cc`, you may `make clean`. Doing so will result in much faster
rebuild times.

#### User Input

##### Playing a Game

To begin a game, a user invokes the program as follows:
```
OmegaZero -p [SIDE] -t [TIME]
```
where `[SIDE]` is the side the user would like to player. This may be `w` for
White, `b` for Black, or `r` for a random selection. `[TIME]` is the amount of time (in seconds) to give the engine during play. This defaults to `5s`.

The format used to denote entered moves is based around [FIDE standard algebraic
notation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Algebraic_Chess_Notation#Standard_Algebraic_Notation_.28SAN.29). The only exception to FIDE notation is that `e.p.` **must** immediately
follow an en passant move without a space (in FIDE rules, this is optional). Further specification is only needed
to avoid ambiguity in a movement command. Some valid example moves are
 - Move pawn to e4: `e4`
 - Move queen to e4: `Qe4`
 - Move pawn to d8 and promote to queen: `d8Q`
 - Pawn takes piece on d6: `exd6`
 - Night takes piece on e4: `Nxe4`
 - Rook on rank 1 moves to a3: `R1a3`
 - Rook on d file moves to f8: `Rdf8`
 - Pawn takes a piece on d8 and promotes to queen: `exd8Q`
 - Queen from h4 moves to e1: `Qh4e1`
 - Queen from h4 takes piece on e1: `Qh4xe1`
 - Pawn from e file takes pawn on d5 in en passant: `exd6e.p.`
 - Queenside castle: `0-0-0`
 - Kingside castle: `0-0`

To resign, a user must enter `q` on their turn.

##### Testing

To print out the [Perft](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft) results for engine, invoke the program as follows:
```
OmegaZero -i [POSITION] -d [DEPTH]
```
`[POSITION]` is a [FEN](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation) formatted string denoting the intial position to
start counting nodes from in the search tree; not providing this will cause the
program to default to the standard initial position in a chess game. 

`[DEPTH]` is a positive integer denoting the number of levels to generate in
the search tree.

After doing this, users have the choice of entering either a move formatted as
previously outlined to walk the search tree, or `q` to exit the program.

The positions on [this page](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results) were used to confirm the correctness of the move
generator.

### Implementation

#### Board Representation

The engine uses both [Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards) and an [8x8 Board](https://www.chessprogramming.org/8x8_Board) to represent board.
states. Squares are indexed in the [Little Endian Rank File (LERF)](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Square_Mapping_Considerations#Little-Endian_Rank-File_Mapping) format.

#### Move Generation

For non-sliding pieces, arrays of bitboards representing all possible places
a piece can move to on an empty board for every square are computed
by `generate_masks.py`. For sliding pieces, move generation is implemented
through the [magic bitboard technique](http://pradu.us/old/Nov27_2008/Buzz/research/magic/Bitboards.pdf).

The move generation function `Engine::GenerateMoves()` is implemented as a
[pseudo-legal generator](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Generation#Pseudo-legal). A full legality check is made in `Board::MakeMove()`
to ensure that a move does not put the moving player in check; illegal moves are
unmade if they are found to do this.

#### Transposition Table

A custom hash table was used to implement the [Transposition Table](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table).
The [Zobrist Hashing](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Zobrist_Hashing) 
algorithm was used to hash board states. This technique an expected collision
rate of one in 2^32 ≈ 4.29 billion. Relatively little can be done
to mitigate this risk, and as such is a known and unavoidable bug with this
implementation. The Transposition Table is [two-tiered](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table#Two-tier_System), using the
"Always Replace" and "Depth-Preferred" replacement schemes in parallel.

#### Search

The [MTD(f)](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MTD(f)) search algorithm is used within an [Iterative Deepening](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Iterative_Deepening)
framework. This routine calls an implementation of the [Negamax](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Negamax) algorithm
with [alpha-beta pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Alpha-Beta), [Null Move Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Null_Move_Pruning), and [Late Move Reduction](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Late_Move_Reductions). A depth reduction value [R](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Depth_Reduction_R)
of 3 is used when depth is greater than 6, and 2 otherwise in Null Move Pruning.
Late Move Reductions are computed using the formula
```
int(sqrt(double(depth-1)) + sqrt(double(move_idx-1)))
```
taken from [Fruit Reloaded](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Fruit_Reloaded). Reduction is only done on non-PV (Principle Variation) nodes. A
Transposition Table is used to cache seen positions, allowing the engine to
store each [node's type](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Node_Types) is and prevent costly re-evaluation of a node. This
is especially important for storing the [Principle Variation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Principal_Variation) during Iterative
Deepening.

After search to a specified depth, all captures are searched during the
[Quiescence Search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Quiescence_Search) to limit the [Horizon Effect](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Horizon_Effect). [Delta Pruning](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Delta_Pruning) is used to
limit the number of nodes explored during Quiescence Search.

To reduce the number of nodes needed to be searched, OmegaZero takes advantage
of a set of heuristics to perform move ordering in `Engine::OrderMoves()` in
order to increase the number of [Beta-Cutoffs](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Beta-Cutoff) during alpha-beta pruning.
Moves are put in the following order:
1. [Hash Move](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Hash_Move)
2. Captures, ordered using the [MVV-LVA](https://www.chessprogramming.org/MVV-LVA) heuristic
3. Two [Killer Moves](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Killer_Heuristic)
4. All other moves

#### Evaluation

The self-play algorithm from AlphaZero was implemented in the scripts under the
`eval_models` script, and a neural network was trained to evaluate board states.

### Performance

#### Move Generation

The move generator is capable of producing up to ~7 million moves/sec.
